**Apply the patch before adding the game to Project Lunar**

### How to apply?
Apply as any other ips patch. I personaly like to use [Lunar Ips](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/).

Simply select `Apply IPS Patch`
![Lunar IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/screenshots/240screenshot1.gif)

- Select you unpatch rom (must be good gen 3.21 with crc: `67A9860B` (USA, Europe), crc: `1E740145` (Korean)).
- Select and Apply the patch (download below)
- Add the patched game to Project Lunar and sync

### Thanks
