**This hmod is to use only with [CompCom's](https://github.com/CompCom) Options Menu.**

### **What is it?**

Largely based on [advokaten's](https://github.com/advokaten) [Remap-Canoe-Controller](https://github.com/advokaten/Remap-Canoe-Controller), this [Options Menu](https://github.com/CompCom/OptionsMenu/releases/latest) module allows you to edit, through the UI, your controller inputs used in Canoe and Kachikachi.

### **Information:**

* Any controller connected to the port(s) at the front of the Mini, will be recognized as a Nintendo Clovercon controller, including controllers connected via Bluetooth receivers such as the 8bitdo Retro Receiver.
* Updated current database with an additional 60 controller mappings for future purpose.
