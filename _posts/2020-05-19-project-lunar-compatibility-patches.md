### How to use this?

Download the `fix_ips.zip` and extract it. 
![Extract patch pack](https://i.imgur.com/PJ7FDC3.png)

Open the the extracted `fix_ips` folder and copy the `IPS` folder to your `lunar_data` directory (usually `%localappdata%\ModMyClassic\Project Lunar Desktop UI\lunar_data`)

Now if your files have no-intro naming you're good to go. If not follow [Mod My Classic's guide](https://modmyclassic.com/project-lunar-how-to-use-the-built-in-rom-patcher/).



### Apply the patch before adding the game to Project Lunar

You probably noticed the `patch-before-adding-the-games` folder on the previous extracted path. 

Due to the way Project Lunar apply the patches, some wont work unless you patch the game before adding it to Project Lunar.

### How to apply?

Apply as any other ips patch. I personally like to use [Lunar Ips](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/).

Simply select `Apply IPS Patch` ![Lunar IPS](https://i.imgur.com/RBT7uHY.png)

* Select you unpatch rom.
* Select and Apply the patch.
* Add the patched game to Project Lunar and sync
